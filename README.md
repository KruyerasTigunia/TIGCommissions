Tigunia Commission App

## Introduction
The Commissions Add-on App by Tigunia was designed to remove typical design constraints and offer as many unlimited setups and options as possible.

 For example, there is no limitation between a Brand and a Sub Brand. Any Brand can have as many child brands (sub brands) as desired, and each of those can have as many child brands as desired. Contracts are a separate entity and can be assigned to a given Brand. There can be multiple contracts assigned to a Brand with multiple Payees per Contract. 
Another important design aspect is that this Add-on can be installed at any time and still be able to report on data. There is no wait time after implementation before the data is usable.
